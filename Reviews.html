                    <p>Hades is one of if not the best roguelite game on the market as it perfectly combines aspects of gameplay, style, music, and story. The characters throughout the game are interersting, unique and each have thier own story to tell. The bosses in the game are enjoyable to fight along with the enemies. The combat could be better in my opinion</p>
                    <p>This game is the <b>4th</b> highest rated game on steam and I would highly recomend it to anyone who enjoys roguelikes. This game isn't all that difficult at the start but as you progress it gets far more difficult and it is nice to see yourself adapt to the different enemies and gameplay mechanics</p>

                    <p>This game is the perfection of the survival genre but it is more a boss rush game half way through. Terraria has an incredibly good progression system with various differnt classes which you can use to kill enemies and bosses with along with having a simple yet extremely fun combat and movement system. Terraria doesn't lean all that much into the survival craft genre as you become extremely powerful in the end game but the open world aspect is extremely gun as you get to explore caves and discover the world that you generate. Terraria also uses a seed system to give each individial person thier own unique world.</p>
                    <p>Terraria doesn't actually have a plot unlike most games but it does have lore which has been given to the public but it doesn't really change how you play or experience the game.</p>
                    <p>This game is also not for the kind of person who hates grinding as this game will have you spending an hour or 5 trying to get one item. You also need to have the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria_Wiki">Terraria wiki</a> open at all times when playing this game as you will be checking drop chances, how to summon bosses and how to progress in general throughout the game which some people may find annoying, but i found it to be just another charm of the game. </p>

                        <p>Halo is a game which I have spent an unhealthy amount of time playing and for good reason as it is one of if not the best shooter games in history. With the franshise being 23 years old this year it has amassed a huge devoted community which isn't extremely toxic like others (sea of thieves). Halo has 13 games in its franchise that I know of with some being better than others but the ones I'l be focusing on will be Halo ce, 2, 3, 3 odst, reach, 4, 5, and infinite</p>
                        <p><b>Halo ce:</b> (Combat evolved) is the first game in the franchise and is incredibly good but you need to be consious of how old it is when playing. DO NOT PLAY THE ANIVERSARY VERSION it completely ruins the games atmosphere.</p>
                        <p><b>Halo 2:</b> was extremely popular and is the most sold game for the original Xbox and in my opinion is a downgrade of the first game gameplay wise but its plot is incredibly good and with the remaster it looks beautiful.</p>
                        <p><b>Halo 3:</b> is just the best of the trilogy and perfecty combines all the aspects of the previous games <b>10/10</b>.</p>
                        <p><b>Halo 3 ODST:</b> is a verson of Halo 3 where you play during the events of Halo 2 but as an odst and it is just very well made.</p>
                        <p><b>Halo Reach:</b> is my personal favourite as it has incredibly well made gameplay and the story is beautiful. This game is a lot darker than any other game since it is based on a book.</p>
                        <p><b>Halo 4:</b> was the first game in the series developed by 343 industries after microsofts contract with Bungie ende. Halo 4 built off the trend of call of duty games which caused its multiplayer to suffer but the campaign is really well done with both gameplay and plot (except for knights)</p>
                        <p><b>Halo 5:</b> is unanimously the worst mains stream Halo game due to it not living up to its hype and you not playing as Master Chief through most of the game and the guy your playing as is kinda uninteresting</p>
                        <p><b>Halo Infinite:</b> had the longest and saddest development as it was capible of so much but just couldn't deliver due to the poor managment of the studio which resulted in its higher ups getting replaced. The game itslef is really fun but the plot and its open world (this is the only open world one) are just lacking</p>

                    <p>Stardew valley is an incredible feat in itself as this game was made but one person over 4 and a half years. This game has perfect story, characters, and music but the gameplay gets repetitve over time and later in the game you begin to get stressed over how little you spent the day doing which just made me stop playing the game without ever making it to the third year.</p>
                    <p>If there is one thing this game does well it has an incredible atmosphere with its incredibly good art and characters which really got me invested</p>

                    <p>Portal 2 is (in my opinion) the <b>best</b> puzzle game of all time. Portal 2 has such a basic idea behind it yet it is executed so incredibly well that the game is truly a masterpiece.</p>
                    <p>If you ever play this game you <b>need to play portal 1</b> otherwise you will have no idea what is going on throughout the game and will miss out on key elements of the game and thus not enjoy iy as much. The amount of jokes and little bits the game does is incredibly entertaining and unless you are stuck on a level there won't be a time where you aren't enjoying yourself. This game is also incredibly well optimised and even though it has incredibly good graphics it came out in 2011.</p>
